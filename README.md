# Electrostatic Tinkers Toys [![Discord][discordImg]][discordLink] [![Curseforge][curseImg]][curseLink]


**Electrostatic Tinkers Toys** adds a new modifier to Tinkers' Construct using materials from Thermal Expansion, Mekanism or EnderIO

## 🚀 Getting Started
Below you will find anything you need to know. If you want to download a build you can do it via CurseForge. 

## 📇 Modifiers

* **Flux:** Gives your tools a ~~**RF**~~ **FE** Energy Buffer that is consumed instead of durability if it has charge. This upgrade can be stacked for multiple upgrades. This recipe is pretty easy and I advise pack makers to use Craft Tweaker to make it a little harder.
