# MEMES
**Modular Electro-Mechanical Enhancement Systems** adds two new modifiers to Tinkers' Construct using Mekanism materials:

* **Electromechanical actuator (Electromechanical):** Gives your tools an energy buffer that's consumed instead of durability. Each tier adds more FE capacity.
* **Ultimate control circuit (Disassembling):** Makes your tools destroy entire veins of ore or entire blobs of logs in one swing.
* **Flux field phaser (Directed Flux Field):** Causes already-electrical tools (e.g. PlusTiC laser gun) to consumer their energy buffer in place of durability.

Additionally, a modifier is added for Construct's Armoury armour pieces:

* **Electromechanical actuator (Electromechanical):** Makes your armour run on FE before consuming durability. Each tier adds more FE capacity.
